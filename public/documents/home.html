      Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document;
      formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of
      the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic
      characters thrown in.

<h3>What does this app</h3>
<p>
  In some (several?) cases, wikis, blogs, etc... are over complicated.<br/>
  The main purpose of this application is to allow co-workers sharing their knowledge  through a simple but efficient solution !
</p>
<p>
  Here is the list of the main features available in this version :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protect every document behind an authentication process</li>
  <li>CRUD operations available on all documents</li>
  <li>Markdown edition with real-time HTML renderer, shortcuts for markdown edition </li>
  <li>Code syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Fully responsive design</li>
</ul>

<h3>What this app does not (yet!)</h3>
<p>
  At this time we are in front of one-day coding app, a more or less .
  If we find some interest in the concepts,
  here is a list of improvements this app could have in a near future :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download documents as PDF (generated from Markdown)</li>
  <li>Categorize documents with tags</li>
  <li>Manage visibility through a concept of circles and subscriptions</li>
  <li>Adding a global search (and not just a filter on title)</li>
  <li>Consider the document's visibility for non connected user (public documents)</li>
  <li>Tracking the documents' modification (using Git ?)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Plus, it's completely open sourced, fork us on <a href="https://www.github.com/boissonnat">GitHub</a>.
